This is my very first post! It's still hard for me to believe I finished my comp sci degree two days ago. My very next thought after graduating was 
"Yes, now I have time for personal projects!".Designing a portfolio site has been on my to-do list for a while now. Even though I've been learning programming for the last few years, I've only recently started to put it all together enough to build something. 

When I started my Capstone in October, I did not feel ready enough to build anything full-stack or presentable. I figured I would rely on my team to help guide my
code. Instead, I ended up as lead developer. Despite some giant fears, I was able to pick up some new technologies and build a full-stack task management application. **Mistakes were made!** I did so many things wrong, and my repo is a hot mess. However, I learned more in 8 weeks than I did in the entire year. 

Looking back, the reason I had not built a cohesive project yet was because I was afraid of doing it wrong. Sometimes it's hard to rememebr that mistakes are learning opportunities. I plan on going back to the project and seeing where I can make it better. As embarassing as the repo is for me, I want to put it on here anyways so I can look back in a few months and laugh. Maybe someone else will see it and feel less intimidated to build a project.
