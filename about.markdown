# I'm Vanessa #

![Vanessa Arreola](/assets/head-shot.jpg)

I graduated from the University of Maryland's Global Campus with a 
Bachelor's of Computer Science. I also have a Bachelor's of Psychology. 
I am a cross-functional developer, currently working as a technical 
consultant. My passion is backend development. As a seasoned military spouse, 
I have a varied background. I've done everything from substitute teaching to 
teaching group fitness classes. But programming is my true calling.

# My preferred tech stack is: #

- Java (Spring boot and Hibernate) for backend
- React or Angular for frontend
- MySQL or PostgreSQL for database

![I Love Hiking](/assets/hiking.jpg)

My favorite activity is usually anything outdoors. I am an avid hiker, and I love to camp. If 
I can't hike, I love to hang out outdoors.
I enjoy reading. I read 60-70 books a year. You can see my latest reads 
on <b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/vanessaarreola" target="_blank">Goodreads</a></b>.
